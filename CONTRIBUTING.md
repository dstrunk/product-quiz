## Contributing to Product Quiz Recommendations

Thanks for considering this project as one to contribute to!

### Did you find a bug?

- **First, ensure the bug has not already been reported** by searching on GitHub
  under [Issues](https://github.com/dstrunk/product-quiz/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the
  problem, [open a new issue](https://github.com/dstrunk/product-quiz/issues/new). Be sure to use the pull request
  template to address the following:
  - **Title**
  - **Clear description**
  - As many relevant details as possible, and include a **code sample** or **reproducible steps** demonstrating the
    expected behaviour that is not occurring

### Are you looking to add additional functionality?

Changes to the functionality of this module are welcomed, but please note that introduction of these features lies 
at the discretion of the maintainer. Feature additions will be entertained, but if it is determined that the cost of 
maintaining a new feature is outside the scope of the original project, **it will not be merged into the codebase**.

Instead of working on a new feature and submitting a pull request directly, you should
instead [open a new issue](https://github.com/dstrunk/product-quiz/issues/new) proposing the new feature. If this 
feature is accepted, it will be tagged with an `accepted` tag, and pull requests supporting the feature will be 
accepted.

When submitting a pull request for an `accepted` feature, be sure to reference the relevant issue number in the pull 
request.
